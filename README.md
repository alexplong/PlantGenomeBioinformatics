GENE = AT1G04020
Other names: ATBARD1, BARD1, BREAST CANCER ASSOCIATED RING 1, REPRESSOR OF WUSCHEL1, ROW1

Encodes a protein containing two tandem BRCA1 C-Terminal (BRCT) domains, which function in phosphorylation-dependent proteinâ€“protein interactions. Loss of function mutations cause defects in meristem organization due to failure to repress WUS. BARD1 binds to WUS promoter and over expression of BARD reduces the extent of WUS expression.
